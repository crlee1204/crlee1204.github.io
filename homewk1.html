            <p>My name is Chia Rong Lee and I am a student of College of San Mateo,
                this is my third semester in CSM. 
            </p>    
        
            <p id = "second_p">I am attending this class, because I want to get a certificate of 
                Web/Mobile Appplication Development, I have a Computer Science background and used to work for 
                Semiconductor company, but I am transitioning to the world of Web Development.  
                It is a required course for me to complete this class, since I have basic knowledge of
                Web, such as HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Java, and SQL, now I try to put those knowledge 
                together for this CIS-128 Mobile Web Application course.

                    Database/SQL books.</strong> If you are new to Web design or an old pro, these books are 
                    must-have in my opinion. I love how it starts out with the basics and then moves

                    how to do the most common techniques that you will face as a web developer/designer.
