        <p>My name is Chia Rong Lee and I am a student of College of San Mateo,
           this is my third semester in CSM. </p>    
        
        <p id = "second_p">I am attending this class, because I want to get a certificate of 
            Web/Mobile Appplication Development, I have a Computer Science background and used to work for 
            Semiconductor company, but I am transitioning to the world of Web Development.  
            It is a required course for me to complete this class, since I have basic knowledge of
            Web, such as HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Java, and SQL, now I try to put those knowledge 
            together for this CIS-128 Mobile Web Application course.

            <p> This publisher is offering <strong>Web development books, Programming language books and
                Database/SQL books.</strong> If you are new to Web design or an old pro, these books are 
                must-have in my opinion. I love how it starts out with the basics and then moves
                on to the good stuff. Each chapter is full of examples and sample code showing you 
                how to do the most common techniques that you will face as a web developer/designer.
